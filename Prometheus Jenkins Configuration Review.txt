Your Prometheus configuration is mostly correct, but I would suggest a couple of small changes and clarifications to ensure proper functionality.

Global Section:

The scrape_interval and evaluation_interval are set to 15s, which is fine if you need that level of granularity. However, make sure it aligns with your infrastructure's performance requirements.
Scrape Config for Jenkins:

The metrics_path: '/prometheus' is correct if Jenkins is properly configured with a Prometheus plugin that exposes metrics at /prometheus. You must ensure the Prometheus plugin is installed and correctly configured in Jenkins.
Here is the revised configuration for clarity:

yaml
Copy code
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'jenkins'
    metrics_path: '/prometheus'   # Ensure Jenkins is exposing metrics at this path
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
Key Points:
Ensure that Jenkins is running and that the Prometheus plugin is installed and configured to expose metrics at /prometheus.
If Jenkins is on a different host or port, modify the targets accordingly (e.g., replace localhost with the correct IP address or hostname).
Keep in mind that scrape_interval: 15s could put a lot of load on both Prometheus and Jenkins, depending on the size of your environment.

what are the thing i can do with prometheus.yml
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The prometheus.yml file is the core configuration file for Prometheus. It allows you to define how Prometheus scrapes metrics from different services and systems, how it evaluates rules, and other global settings. Here's an outline of what you can do with prometheus.yml:

1. Global Configuration:
The global section sets default values that apply to all scrape jobs unless overridden. Key options include:

scrape_interval: Frequency of scraping metrics from targets. Default is 1 minute.

yaml
Copy code
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # Set for faster or slower scraping frequency
evaluation_interval: Frequency of evaluating recording and alerting rules.

yaml
Copy code
global:
  evaluation_interval: 15s  # How often rules are evaluated
scrape_timeout: Maximum duration before a scrape times out.

yaml
Copy code
global:
  scrape_timeout: 10s
2. Scrape Configuration:
The scrape_configs section defines which targets Prometheus will scrape metrics from. Each target is associated with a job_name and can be customized with additional settings. You can:

Define targets (either statically or dynamically).

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my_service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080', 'otherhost:9090']
Metrics Path: Customize the path for scraping metrics (default is /metrics).

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'my_service'
    metrics_path: '/custom_metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
Relabeling: Modify or filter out labels dynamically before storing metrics.

yaml
Copy code
relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__address__]
    regex: 'localhost.*'
    action: drop
HTTP Settings: Customize HTTP headers or add authentication for scraping targets.

yaml
Copy code
basic_auth:
  username: 'admin'
  password: 'password123'
Service Discovery: Discover targets dynamically via methods like DNS, Consul, Kubernetes, etc.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
3. Alerting Rules:
You can define alerting rules to trigger alerts when certain conditions are met (e.g., when a service is down or resource usage exceeds a threshold).

Example of an alerting rule:
yaml
Copy code
rule_files:
  - "alert.rules"

groups:
- name: alert_rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: process_cpu_seconds_total > 1000
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU Usage"
      description: "The CPU usage has exceeded 1000 seconds in the last 2 minutes."
4. Recording Rules:
Recording rules allow you to precompute frequently needed or complex expressions and save them as new time series to reduce computational overhead during queries.

Example of a recording rule:
yaml
Copy code
groups:
- name: recording_rules
  rules:
  - record: job:process_cpu:avg_rate5m
    expr: avg(rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (job)
5. Relabeling:
Relabeling is a powerful feature in Prometheus, allowing you to dynamically modify label values before they are stored in Prometheus.

Example: Drop or rename labels.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'example'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['__address__']
        regex: 'localhost.*'
        action: drop
Metrics filtering: Drop specific metrics to optimize storage.

yaml
Copy code
metric_relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: ['__name__']
    regex: 'unwanted_metric.*'
    action: drop
6. Remote Write/Read:
Prometheus supports remote write and remote read, allowing you to send time series data to external systems for long-term storage or for querying external systems.

Remote Write: Send data to a remote system (e.g., Thanos, Cortex).

yaml
Copy code
remote_write:
  - url: 'http://remote-system:9090/api/v1/write'
Remote Read: Query data from a remote system.

yaml
Copy code
remote_read:
  - url: 'http://remote-system:9090/api/v1/read'
7. Alertmanagers Configuration:
Prometheus can be integrated with Alertmanager to handle alerts (like sending notifications, silencing, or deduplicating). You can configure multiple Alertmanagers for high availability.

Example:
yaml
Copy code
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'localhost:9093'
8. Logging and Performance:
Log Level: Adjust the verbosity of logs for debugging.

yaml
Copy code
log_level: debug
TSDB Settings: Tweak the time series database (TSDB) performance parameters.

yaml
Copy code
storage.tsdb.retention.time: 15d  # Retain data for 15 days
9. Label and Metric Filtering:
You can drop or modify labels and metrics on specific jobs, reducing data ingestion load by focusing on important metrics.

Metric Relabeling:
yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'service'
    metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['__name__']
        regex: 'expensive_metric.*'
        action: drop
Conclusion:
In summary, prometheus.yml allows you to control many aspects of Prometheus, such as scrape intervals, alerting, service discovery, and data retention. You can use it to optimize performance, integrate with other tools, and ensure your Prometheus deployment is both efficient and scalable.

most of the used prometheus.yml scripts in major it devops comapanies
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In major IT and DevOps environments, Prometheus is widely adopted due to its flexible configuration, powerful query language (PromQL), and native support for cloud-native architectures like Kubernetes. The prometheus.yml files used in these environments typically follow patterns that optimize for scalability, security, and integration with other DevOps tools like Grafana, Alertmanager, and CI/CD pipelines.

Here are some common prometheus.yml configurations and patterns used in major IT/DevOps companies:

1. Kubernetes Service Discovery
Kubernetes is one of the most commonly used platforms in DevOps. Prometheus integrates seamlessly with it by using service discovery to dynamically discover services and workloads.

yaml
Copy code
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
        action: replace
        target_label: __metrics_path__
        regex: (.+)
      - source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
        action: replace
        target_label: __address__
        regex: (.+):(?:\d+);(.+)
        replacement: ${1}:${2}
Explanation:
Prometheus scrapes metrics from all running pods that have the annotation prometheus.io/scrape=true.
The relabel_configs section ensures that only pods with certain annotations are scraped.
Use Case: This is ideal for dynamic environments like Kubernetes, where services and applications are constantly changing.
2. Node Exporter for Host Metrics
node_exporter is one of the most commonly used Prometheus exporters in production. It collects hardware and OS-level metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node1:9100', 'node2:9100']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: instance
Explanation:
Static configuration to scrape metrics from node_exporter running on multiple nodes.
Use Case: This is standard in environments with a mixture of cloud and bare-metal servers.
3. Jenkins Metrics for CI/CD Pipelines
In DevOps companies using Jenkins for CI/CD, Prometheus can be configured to scrape Jenkins metrics.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'jenkins'
    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['jenkins-server:8080']
    basic_auth:
      username: 'admin'
      password: 'password'
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['__address__']
        target_label: instance
Explanation:
Prometheus scrapes Jenkins metrics (via the Prometheus plugin in Jenkins).
basic_auth is used for secure access to Jenkins.
Use Case: CI/CD monitoring is a critical part of the DevOps pipeline. Jenkins metrics, including job success/failure, job queue times, and build durations, are essential for monitoring.
4. Blackbox Exporter for External Monitoring
Companies often use blackbox exporter to monitor the health and uptime of external endpoints (websites, APIs).

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx]
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - https://example.com
          - https://api.example.com
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - target_label: instance
        replacement: blackbox-exporter
    scheme: http
Explanation:
The blackbox_exporter probes URLs to check if the service is up and responding with a 2xx HTTP status.
Use Case: This is common for monitoring customer-facing services to ensure high availability and reliability.
5. HAProxy/NGINX for Load Balancer Monitoring
Prometheus can scrape metrics from HAProxy or NGINX load balancers, which is essential for monitoring request latency, error rates, and backend health.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'haproxy'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['haproxy-server:8404']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scheme: http
Explanation:
Prometheus scrapes metrics from HAProxy via the /metrics endpoint.
Use Case: This is standard for companies that handle large-scale traffic and need to monitor their load balancer performance and backend server health.
6. Alertmanager Integration for Alerting
In large IT companies, Prometheus is usually integrated with Alertmanager to handle alerting rules and notification routing (e.g., sending alerts via email, Slack, or PagerDuty).

yaml
Copy code
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['alertmanager1:9093', 'alertmanager2:9093']

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'alertmanager'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['alertmanager1:9093']
Explanation:
Prometheus is configured to send alerts to multiple Alertmanager instances for high availability.
Use Case: This is used to ensure that alerts are reliably routed to notification systems in case of failures.
7. Thanos/Cortex for Long-Term Storage
For large organizations, Prometheus’s retention limits are often too short. Thanos or Cortex is used for long-term storage and global query capabilities.

yaml
Copy code
remote_write:
  - url: "http://thanos-receiver:9201/api/v1/receive"

remote_read:
  - url: "http://thanos-store-gateway:10901/api/v1/query"
Explanation:
remote_write and remote_read allow Prometheus to offload data to Thanos for long-term storage and query across multiple Prometheus instances.
Use Case: Companies that need long-term historical data for compliance or detailed analysis use this setup.
8. Relabeling for Filtering and Optimization
In large-scale environments, relabeling is critical for reducing unnecessary metrics ingestion and optimizing resource usage.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
        action: keep
        regex: monitoring|production
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        action: replace
        target_label: app
        regex: (.+)
Explanation:
Relabeling is used to filter namespaces and retain only metrics from important namespaces like monitoring and production.
Labels are also renamed (or added) for better clarity in queries.
Use Case: Companies running large Kubernetes clusters use this to control the amount of data ingested into Prometheus.
9. Security and TLS Settings
For secure environments, Prometheus can be configured with TLS and authentication when scraping targets or integrating with remote systems.

yaml
Copy code
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'secure-target'
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: /etc/prometheus/certs/ca.crt
      cert_file: /etc/prometheus/certs/client.crt
      key_file: /etc/prometheus/certs/client.key
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['secure-service:443']
    basic_auth:
      username: 'secure-user'
      password: 'secure-pass'
Explanation:
TLS settings and basic authentication ensure that Prometheus scrapes secure services without exposing credentials.
Use Case: Companies with sensitive data or compliance requirements (e.g., banking, healthcare) use this configuration.
Conclusion
In major DevOps companies, Prometheus is integrated into complex infrastructures that include Kubernetes, 
Jenkins, load balancers (like HAProxy or NGINX), and CI/CD pipelines. They use a variety of exporters, alerting tools (e.g., Alertmanager), and 
often rely on long-term storage solutions (Thanos/Cortex). Key patterns involve service discovery, relabeling, security, and monitoring uptime through blackbox exporters. 
Customization is key to optimizing performance and ensuring scalability across large-scale environments.
