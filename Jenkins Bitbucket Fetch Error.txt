The error message you're encountering indicates that Jenkins is unable to fetch the code from the remote Git repository hosted on Bitbucket. The issue seems to be related to authentication or repository access. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and steps to resolve this issue:

Potential Causes:
Repository Access Issues:

The error message suggests that either the repository does not exist or the Jenkins instance does not have proper access to it.
The URL https://bitbucket.org/numeracle-202/numercleweb might be incorrect, or the repository has been deleted or renamed.
Invalid Credentials:

Jenkins is attempting to use a credential (2566e7d4-586f-4a39-b4c5-b01b29268633) to access the repository, but it seems that the authentication is failing. This could be due to expired or invalid credentials.
Permission Issues:

The user whose credentials are being used may not have sufficient permissions to access the repository on Bitbucket. This can happen if the user was removed from the repository or workspace, or if their access rights were changed.
Steps to Resolve:
1. Verify Repository URL:
Double-check the URL of the repository. Log in to Bitbucket and ensure that the repository numercleweb exists and is under the numeracle-202 workspace.
If the repository URL has changed, update the Jenkins configuration to point to the correct URL.
2. Check and Update Credentials:
In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Credentials and verify the credentials being used (2566e7d4-586f-4a39-b4c5-b01b29268633).
Ensure the credentials are valid. If you are using HTTPS with a username and password (or personal access token), make sure they are correct and haven't expired.
If using SSH, ensure that Jenkins is using the correct SSH keys, and that the public key has been added to the Bitbucket repository’s or workspace’s SSH settings.
3. Check Bitbucket Permissions:
Confirm that the user associated with the credentials has access to the repository. In Bitbucket, navigate to the repository’s settings and verify that the user or service account has read (or write) access.
If the repository is private, ensure that the user or service account has the necessary permissions.
4. Test Access from the Jenkins Server:
To rule out Jenkins-specific issues, manually test the Git connection from the Jenkins server. SSH into the Jenkins server and run:
bash
Copy code
git ls-remote https://bitbucket.org/numeracle-202/numercleweb
If this command also fails, it confirms a problem with credentials or access rights.
5. Reconfigure GIT_ASKPASS:
If you're using GIT_ASKPASS for credentials, confirm that the helper script or mechanism used is correctly providing the necessary credentials. Sometimes this may need to be reset or adjusted to match the current authentication method (e.g., token-based authentication).
By following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint and resolve the issue preventing Jenkins from accessing the Bitbucket repository.

3. Sample Jenkins Pipeline (Groovy Script) for Bitbucket
Below is a sample Jenkinsfile written in Groovy that demonstrates how to integrate Jenkins with Bitbucket. This script checks out code from a Bitbucket repository, builds the project, and handles post-build actions.

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        // Define any environment variables here
        BITBUCKET_CREDENTIALS = 'bitbucket-pat' // Replace with your credentials ID
        REPO_URL = 'https://bitbucket.org/numeracle-202/numercleweb.git'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout code from Bitbucket
                git(
                    url: "${env.REPO_URL}",
                    credentialsId: "${env.BITBUCKET_CREDENTIALS}",
                    branch: 'main' // Specify the branch you want to build
                )
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Example build step (adjust according to your project)
                sh './gradlew build' // For Gradle projects
                // sh 'mvn clean install' // For Maven projects
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Example test step
                sh './gradlew test' // For Gradle projects
                // sh 'mvn test' // For Maven projects
            }
            post {
                always {
                    // Archive test results, if applicable
                    junit '**/build/test-results/**/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Example deployment step
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                // Add your deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Notify success (e.g., Slack, email)
            echo 'Build succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            // Notify failure
            echo 'Build failed!'
        }
        always {
            // Cleanup actions, if any
            cleanWs()
        }
    }
}

Based on the error and the script you provided, there could be a few areas where adjustments are needed, particularly in the stages involving SSH and deployment. Here's an analysis of the potential issues and solutions:

Potential Issues
Credentials ID in BIT CHECKOUT stage: You have written credentialsId: 'enter-id', which is a placeholder. You need to replace 'enter-id' with the actual ID of the credentials stored in Jenkins.

SSH Known Hosts Setup: In the DEPLOY stage, the check for ~/.ssh/known_hosts may not work properly, as the path for Jenkins might differ. The check should be done in the workspace or adjust the path as needed.

SSH Agent Setup: Make sure that the Linux credential in sshagent block is properly configured with the correct credentials.

WAR file packaging: Ensure that the path target/*.war is correct and matches the packaging output of the mvn package command.

Tomcat directory permissions: Ensure that the user ec2-user has the appropriate permissions to write to the $TOMCAT_WEBAPPS directory on the target server.

Updated Jenkins Pipeline Script
Here is an updated version of your Jenkins Pipeline script with changes based on the potential errors:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        jdk 'jdk11'
        maven 'maven'
    }

    environment {

    }

    stages {
        stage('BIT CHECKOUT') {
            steps {
                // Use the correct credentials ID for Bitbucket
                git branch: 'bandwidth_numweb_aug2024', 
                url: 'https://bitbucket.org/numeracle-202/numercleweb.git', 
                credentialsId: 'bitbucket-credentials-id'  // Replace with actual Bitbucket credentials ID
            }
        }

        stage('CLEAN') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean"
            }
        }

        stage('COMPILE') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn compile"
            }
        }

        stage('PKG') {
            steps {
                // Ensure WAR packaging is correctly defined
                sh "mvn package -Dpackaging=war"
            }
        }

        stage('DEPLOY') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Correct known_hosts file path for Jenkins agent
                    if (!fileExists("${env.HOME}/.ssh/known_hosts")) {
                        sh 'ssh-keyscan 10.0.16.79 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts'
                    }
                }
                
                // Use correct credentials ID for Linux SSH access
                sshagent (credentials: ['linux-ssh-credentials-id']) {  // Replace with actual SSH credentials ID
                    // Transfer the WAR file to the remote server's Tomcat directory
                    sh "rsync -avz -e ssh target/*.war ec2-user@10.0.16.79:${TOMCAT_WEBAPPS}"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Build and deployment completed successfully!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build or deployment failed.'
        }
    }
}
Changes & Improvements
credentialsId Fix in Git Checkout:

Replace 'bitbucket-credentials-id' with the actual credentials ID for Bitbucket stored in Jenkins.
SSH Known Hosts Setup:

Used env.HOME to refer to the current Jenkins agent's home directory to ensure known_hosts is added correctly. If Jenkins is running as a specific user, you may need to customize this path accordingly.
SSH Agent:

Ensure you replace 'linux-ssh-credentials-id' with the actual Jenkins credentials ID for the Linux SSH connection.
WAR File Packaging:

The mvn package command ensures the WAR file is generated in the target directory. Ensure that target/*.war is the correct path and adjust if the output directory is different.
Rsync Deployment:

The rsync command uses the environment variable ${TOMCAT_WEBAPPS} for the destination directory. Ensure that the target machine has correct permissions and the directory is accessible by the ec2-user.
Common SSH Issues to Check:
Permissions on Remote Server: Ensure that the ec2-user has the correct permissions on /opt/tomcat/webapps/.
SSH Key Authentication: Verify that the SSH keys associated with your Jenkins credentials are valid and correctly configured.
Firewall/Security Group: Ensure the Jenkins server has network access (firewall/security group rules) to the EC2 instance at IP 10.0.16.79.
By fixing the credentials, ensuring the correct paths, and properly managing SSH keys, the updated pipeline should resolve the deployment issues.
