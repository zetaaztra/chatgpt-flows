When deploying JavaScript code using Jenkins, there are several plugins that can enhance the process for building, testing, and deploying JavaScript applications. Below is a list of recommended plugins:

1. NodeJS Plugin
Purpose: This plugin integrates Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) into Jenkins.
Usage: It allows Jenkins to run npm or yarn commands, install packages, and execute JavaScript-related scripts.
Configuration: You'll need to configure a Node.js installation, so the plugin can automatically install the necessary Node version for your project.
2. Pipeline Plugin
Purpose: Enables Jenkins to orchestrate complex build, test, and deploy workflows.
Usage: You can define pipelines as code using a Jenkinsfile that includes steps for building, testing, and deploying JavaScript applications.
3. Git Plugin
Purpose: Provides Git integration to pull your JavaScript project code from a repository.
Usage: Jenkins can clone your repository, allowing you to automate the build and deployment process using Git-based source code management (SCM).
4. GitHub Plugin (if you're using GitHub)
Purpose: Integrates GitHub with Jenkins to enable webhooks, PR builds, and commit status reporting.
Usage: Can trigger builds based on GitHub events like commits, pull requests, etc.
5. HTML Publisher Plugin
Purpose: This plugin is useful for publishing HTML reports.
Usage: You can generate and publish test reports from JavaScript testing frameworks (like Jest, Mocha, etc.) in HTML format, and this plugin will display them within Jenkins.
6. JUnit Plugin
Purpose: Allows Jenkins to parse and display test results in JUnit XML format.
Usage: Although primarily for Java, many JavaScript testing frameworks can output JUnit-compatible test results. You can use this plugin to display your test results in Jenkins.
7. SonarQube Scanner Plugin
Purpose: Provides static code analysis for JavaScript projects.
Usage: Integrate with SonarQube to check code quality, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability. This is especially important for ensuring code quality in JavaScript projects.
8. Docker Pipeline Plugin (if you're using Docker)
Purpose: Enables running builds inside Docker containers.
Usage: This can help isolate dependencies for JavaScript applications, especially if you're using a specific Node.js version or other build tools.
9. Slack Notification Plugin (optional)
Purpose: Sends build notifications to Slack.
Usage: Notify your team about the status of builds, test results, or deployments.
10. Environment Injector Plugin
Purpose: Allows injecting environment variables to your builds.
Usage: It can be useful for setting up environment-specific configurations for your JavaScript code, like API keys or other sensitive data.
11. Blue Ocean Plugin (optional)
Purpose: Provides a modern UI for Jenkins pipelines.
Usage: Enhances the user experience for managing and monitoring pipelines, including those that handle JavaScript deployments.
12. NPM Plugin (Alternative to NodeJS plugin)
Purpose: Provides more npm-specific integration into Jenkins.
Usage: Manage npm packages, run npm tasks, and execute build steps as part of Jenkins jobs.
These plugins will help you create an automated pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your JavaScript code efficiently.
If you're using specific tools or frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular), ensure that the corresponding build tools (e.g., webpack, babel) 
are part of your package.json for proper handling within Jenkins.
