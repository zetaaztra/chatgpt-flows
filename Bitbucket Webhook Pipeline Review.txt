my employer uses bitbucket webhook trigger do i need to change somethining in this groovy script

The pipeline script you provided seems mostly correct, but there are a few points to review or update based on your specific setup and Bitbucket webhook triggers:

Webhook Token: Ensure that your-webhook-token in the GenericTrigger block is replaced with the actual token used by Bitbucket to authenticate the trigger.

Environment Variables in Trigger: If you need to reference specific payload data (such as $ref), you might need to ensure that Bitbucket's webhook payload provides the correct information. Double-check the key-value pairs in the genericVariables. The key 'ref' should match the actual JSON payload sent by Bitbucket.

Git Credentials: Replace 'enter-id' with the actual credentialsId from Jenkins for accessing your Bitbucket repository.

Tomcat Deployment Path: Ensure that the Tomcat path ($TOMCAT_WEBAPPS) is correct and points to where your .jar files should be placed within the Tomcat installation. Also, verify that the file being deployed is a .jar, as Tomcat typically deploys .war files. If you're deploying a .war file, you might need to modify the rsync command accordingly.

SSH Known Hosts: The script checks for the existence of ~/.ssh/known_hosts. This is important for SSH fingerprint verification, but ensure that this process works correctly during each pipeline execution.

Bitbucket Branch: Ensure that the branch bandwidth_numweb_aug2024 is the correct branch for deployment. If the branch changes, you might want to parameterize it or modify the pipeline script as needed.

If these changes align with your company's setup, your pipeline should work correctly for triggering from Bitbucket.
